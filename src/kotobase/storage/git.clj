  "Git implementation of immutable blocks and linearizable refs.

  Git is not being used here as a place to *keep files*. It is being used as the
  storage engine itself, because it already is one: a content-addressed object
  database with garbage collection, delta compression, replication, and — the
  part that matters most for this contract — an atomic compare-and-swap on refs.

  ## Why the fit is exact

  `IRefStore/-compare-and-set-ref!` asks for: publish NEXT only if the current
  value is EXPECTED, atomically, reporting the winner on loss. That is
  `git update-ref <ref> <new> <old>` verbatim. Git performs it under a `.lock`
  file with an fsync, and fails without mutating anything when `<old>` does not
  match. `docs/storage-architecture.md` in kotobase notes that IPNS has no such
  primitive and the IPFS provider therefore has to declare itself single-writer;
  git needs no such caveat on a single filesystem.

  `IBlockStore` asks for idempotent CID-keyed immutable bytes. Git objects are
  immutable and content-keyed by construction, so a re-put is a no-op at the
  object layer for free.

  ## Blocks must be reachable, or they are garbage

  The one thing git will do that a database will not is *delete your data*:
  `git gc` prunes objects no ref reaches. So writing a block is not
  `hash-object -w` alone — that leaves a loose object which the next gc is
  entitled to remove. Each batch therefore also commits the blocks into a tree
  under `refs/kotobase/blocks`, which is what makes them durable.

  The tree is built with a scratch index (`GIT_INDEX_FILE`) and plumbing only,
  so no worktree is required and a bare repository works. The commit is
  published with the same CAS used for refs, and retried when a concurrent
  writer wins the race — so two processes writing blocks to one repository is
  safe, not merely usually safe.

  ## What this backend is good at, and what it is not

  Good: durable, replicable (`git push`/`fetch` are the replication protocol),
  fully auditable history of every published head, works offline, needs no
  server, and is already installed everywhere. A database whose entire storage
  layer is inspectable with `git log` is a genuinely different operational
  posture from one behind a JDBC URL.

  Not good: throughput. Every batch rewrites a tree and writes a commit, and
  `-get-blocks` currently spawns one `cat-file` per CID rather than using
  `cat-file --batch` (a real optimisation left undone deliberately — correctness
  first, and the batching is a contained change behind this same protocol).
  Concurrency is safe within one filesystem; across NFS git's own locking
  caveats apply and this backend inherits them rather than fixing them."
